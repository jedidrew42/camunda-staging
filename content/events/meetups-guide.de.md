<h2 class="light lead" id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>
In order to getting you started and enabling every interested community member to build up or contribute to a meetup group, we have created this guide. This might be interesting to you for many reasons such as for networking purposes, to gain public speaking experience or to push your community to the next level. 
</p>
<p>
We have put together a few guidelines to make the beginning easier. In case you are an experienced meetup organizer already, please feel free to contact us via <a href="mailto:events@camunda.com">events@camunda.com</a> for additional guidance. 
</p>

<h2 class="light lead" id="summary">Summary</h2>

* By signing up to be a Camunda User Group organizer, you are agreeing to abide by the <a href="/events/code-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> and to ensure community group participants do so, as well.
* Use your connections to affinity user groups to spread the word about the new group you are building, as well as to find speakers for your events. Affinity user groups are existing groups focusing on topics that are equally interesting to Camunda users such as Java or Javascript groups for example. 
* We are able to support your group with food or beverages. Also, we are happy to connect you with other community members or give recommendations for venues. We will always try our best to support you and your group in the best possible way.
* The venue you are going to choose should provide the necessary equipment and resources such as projector/ screen, bathrooms etc. 
* If you need any help, please feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:events@camunda.com">events@camunda.com</a> 


<h2 class="light lead" id="preevent">Pre-event</h2>
<p>
Before you get your own group started, please make sure that you will have the bandwidth to feed the group with activity and be fully engaged in organizing each meeting. You will be required to take care of the logistical arrangements, as well as the content of the events which also involves finding new speakers on a regular basis for example. Sometimes it might be better to (temporarily) join an already existing group, before starting the commitment.  
</p>

<h2 class="light lead" id="start">Start</h2>
<p>
At the beginning of your group you will need to decide and communicate how regular your meetings will take place. There is no guideline regarding how often a meetup should take place but your members will be curious about when they can expect another meeting to happen and are more likely to stay engaged. 
</p>
<h2 class="light lead" id="meetupcom">Meetup.com</h2>

<p>
Many organizers start their own groups on meetup.com by including the tag "Camunda" and will then be associated to our community groups. However, we are happy to support you by creating a meetup group in our name announcing you as the moderator after you reached out on <a href="mailto:events@camunda.com">events@camunda.com</a>. 
</p>


<h2 class="light lead" id="agenda">The Agenda</h2>

<h3>Find your first topics and speakers</h3>
<p>
It is always great to start with an introduction to Camunda at the beginning of your event and letting all members know that they can approach you if they are interested in presenting at one of your future meetups. Another way to find speakers for your event can be through recommendations of fellow group members or by asking in the group if someone would like to present. When you post a message in the group it would be interesting to know for potential speakers, what topics you would like to focus on at the upcoming meetup, so they have an idea if their presentation and content fits. 
</p>

<h3>Agenda setting for talks</h3>

<p>
For your meeting you should aim to have either one speaker who will speak for about 45 minutes or two speakers who each are willing to speak for 15-20 minutes. After each talk you should schedule some time for a Q&A session of at least 5 minutes. 
</p>
<p>
Our best practice is to open doors 20-30 minutes before the talks are going to start so that everybody can arrive, grab a drink or something to eat, have a little chat with other members and get comfortable. 
</p>
<p>
If there are any questions that could not be answered from a member of the group or you, do not worry and feel free to reach out to the Camunda team via <a href="mailto:events@camunda.com">events@camunda.com</a>. 
</p>

Other agenda options: 

* Open space style meetup 
* (several) Lightning talks
*  Pechakucha presentations
* No talks at all! That means you can use other media like videos or encourage active discussion like a community panel.

<h2 class="light lead" id="scheduling">Scheduling</h2>
<p>
If you would like to provide the opportunity to join your group to people with different and sometimes even unusual schedules, we suggest to switch up the days and times of your meetups now and then. You can have a regular day every other week for example but maybe change it up every other month for one meeting so other interested community members can join. 
You can also ask for feedback in the group what days and times would work best for them to get a better idea of what would “optimal”. 
</p>

<h2 class="light lead" id="venue">Venue</h2>
<p>
We encourage you to benefit from your community contacts and host your meetings in venues close to the group of members you are talking to. These spaces can be community centers, startup/ co-working spaces or offices. If you need help with finding the right place to host your meeting, we are also happy to support you by connecting you with our contacts in your location. 
</p>
<h2 class="light lead" id="refreshments">Refreshments</h2>
<p>
We recommend having drinks and food ready before your community members arrive – no matter if you brought it yourself or ordered it in. We are happy to provide a budget so feel free to email us via <a href="mailto:events@camunda.com">events@camunda.com</a>. 
</p>
<h2 class="light lead" id="sponsorships">Sponsorships</h2>
<p>
You can always cooperate with sponsors who would like to contribute to your meetup no matter if they are going to sponsor food, drinks, the venue or even technical equipment. Please make sure to thank them at the event and also give them a minute or two to deliver their own message, as long as it is not an intense sales pitch. 
</p>
<h2 class="light lead" id="promoting">Promoting your Meetup</h2>
<p>
Besides meetup.com as a platform for communication there are many ways to promote your group. We always recommend making use of all given social media channels where you will find fellow techies who might be interested in the topics you are going to discuss. Camunda for example is very active on Twitter and LinkedIn. Furthermore, we are also happy to email our customers in your location and inform them about your meeting happening. Please contact us via <a href="mailto:events@camunda.com">events@camunda.com</a>. 
</p>
<h2 class="light lead" id="photos">Photos and video recording</h2>
<p>
If you are going to take pictures and record the session we would love to share it as well and will be happy to put them on our Vimeo and YouTube channels to help you promote the meetings. Please feel free to reach out to us if you are looking for someone to record or take pictures – we might have a contact in your location!
</p>
<h2 class="light lead" id="content">Sharing content afterwards</h2>
<p>
Please ask your speakers to send you their slides so you can upload them on Slideshare or other online sharing websites. You can then share it with your members and encourage further engagement. 
</p>

<h2 class="light lead" id="tips">Some more tips</h2>

<h3>Marketing to meetup groups</h3>

<p>
Even though meetup.com provides discussion boards for the groups, we prefer members not to post any marketing, sales or hiring related posts unless it is clearly beneficial to the members of the group.
</p>

<h3>Sponsor announcements </h3>
<p>
We encourage organizers to thank all companies & organizations who supported your meetup in both – the opening, as well as closing remarks of your meeting as a best practice. Here it is always beneficial to be as specific as possible for what exactly you are thanking them and are grateful for. 
</p>
