<p>
The GVL aggregates millions of usage reports for musical and cinematographic works from various sources every year. To cope with this amount of incoming data, a transparent and audit-proof data aggregation system was desired to be built. The solution was a DMN rule-based approach embedded in camunda's proccess engine framework, altogether with an audit-proof storage of the process history data. This system is capable of simulating the process flow for any processed data record at any later point in time, in case of a need for revision or validation. The GVL currently runs this scalable system with a troughput of more than one million daily process instances.
