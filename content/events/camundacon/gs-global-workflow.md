<p>
Goldman Sachs Workflow systems provide vital infrastructure to the operation of the firm, coordinating the execution and delivery of millions of business-critical tasks across the entire Firm (including trade facilitation, regulatory rule computation, exception processing coordination, personnel onboarding and thousands of other business processes).
</p>
<p>
In this presentation, you will learn how Goldman Sachs is leveraging Camunda software at the heart of two of its Workflow platforms:
<ul>
<li>
Workflow Elements – The Camunda process execution engine is integrated with a task engine, task cache and entitlements cache, wrapped by REST APIs, to implement a “managed appliance” which integrates with Firm systems and orchestrates both human and system processes at enterprise scale.
</li>
<li>
Decision Services Platform – The Camunda process execution engine is leveraged in our in-memory Decision Flow engine. The engine integrates high-performance rule execution with data integration in an extension of the DMN standard. The platform leverages GS’s own open-source jDMN execution engine.
</li>
</ul>
