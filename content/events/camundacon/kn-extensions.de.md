{{<camundacon-talk title="Process Extensions in a Distributed Environment" date="Thursday, September 20, 3:30 pm" speakers="Stefan Becke, Patrick Schalk" headshot="stefan.jpg" headshot2="patrick.png" about2="Patrick Schalk - I'm a senior consultant and BPM craftsman at Holisticon AG, an IT and Management consulting company in Hamburg, Germany. For five years I've been working in projects with Camunda BPM and I really enjoyed it. I mostly worked with JEE and Spring, but I’m also very interested into Go (the programming language). If I'm not programming, I’m probably off climbing somewhere." about="Stefan Becke is working as Lead Architect at Kuehne + Nagel (AG & Co.) KG. He has more than 10 years experiences within the software development and a passion for Java/BPM open-source technologies.">}}
<p>
Kuehne + Nagel is one of the most successful logistics providers with more than 1,300 offices in over 100 countries and approximately 70,000 specialized employees. The introduction of SALOG, Kuehne + Nagel’s standardized global operating system for seafreight and airfreight simplifies operational activities by increasing process automation. This application guides the user through the operational process of a shipment and indicates WHO needs to do a task (WHAT) at a certain point in time (WHEN).

<p>
One main requirement is the extension of global process definitions to local requirements. Take for example “Customs Handling” which process is defined on a global level but may have to be enhanced to local requirements. These local process extensions should run on dedicated process-engines in a distributed environment while human tasks for local processes have to be handled in the same way as on global level. 
</p>
<p>
A technical oriented process handles the communication flows between global- and local process-engine. The usage of BPMN provides us even for this kind of loosely coupled integration scenario a high visibility.
