{{<camundacon-talk title="Ramping up: Camunda BPM and Optimize" date="Thursday, September 20, 4:20 pm" speakers="Johannes Eltgen" headshot="johannes.jpg" about="Johannes Eltgen works as Head of IT Management at Visana Services AG. I love my job, being on the interface between Business, IT and Management, right where for example BPM takes place.  Before joining Visana I was working almost a decade as an external consultant for various consulting companies, implementing and customizing workflow solutions in the Financial Services industry. I have a background in Computer Science." >}}
<p>
Visana is one of the leading insurance companies in Switzerland with a focus on health insurance, being known as a market leader when it comes to customer satisfaction and quality. As the health insurance market is regulated and product innovation kind of complicated, we have set a focus on re-thinking and optimizing our processes in the last few months, surfing on the wave of digitalization.

<p>
With Camunda as our preferred supplier we have established Camunda BPM as a core system - handling our most important core processes â€“ and Camunda Optimize to further understand and improve them. All that talking about a few couple of months.
</p>
<p>
We want to share our exciting story about routing millions of documents, matching employee skills to existing tasks and other interesting insights. Our journey has started with a proof of concept, implementing BPM in an iterative setup and finally leading to a different way how we think, see and handle our internal processes and organization.
