With all our orchestration, transformation and business rules buried in java code it was becoming time consuming to understand how our systems operated, bring new hires up to speed and answer use case questions. Due to the complexity of our business rules and the general mistakes that naturally take place in human communication, it was time consuming and error prone to translate information from the product owners to developers and vice versa.  In this brief talk, I will demonstrate how 24 Hour Fitness is using Camunda to overcome this problem.
