The world is going digital. Within the next few years, business processes will be automated to an extent that we can barely imagine today. Almost any disruption of traditional industries with new business models--sometimes executed by existing organizations that modernize their infrastructure (often referred to as “digital transformation”), sometimes executed by new startups in industries such as fintech--requires a high degree of complex business process automation.

To this end, many new technologies are added to the mix, including up-and-coming trends such as RPA or microservices orchestration. Workflow automation sits at the very center of this technology puzzle and is an indispensable cornerstone for the vast majority of business process automation endeavours.

In my keynote,  I will explain why workflow automation technology can make or break your digital business, how this technology is evolving, and how it fits with other pieces of the puzzle.
