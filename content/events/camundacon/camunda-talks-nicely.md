{{<camundacon-talk title="Camunda talks Nicely with Others" date="Thursday, September 20, 2:20 pm" speakers="Niall Deehan, Consultant at Camunda" headshot="niall.jpg" about="I spend my time helping people with the design and implementation of system orchestrators. Often for distributed systems and always with Open Source solutions – as a Consultant for Camunda BPM, it’s technology is at the core of what I create. I find it’s time very well spent.">}}
