The challenge was to develop and establish a new middleware solution for the OTELO brand and the branded reseller business. The intention was not only to develop a modern system based on JEE 7, but also to transform Vodafone's collaboration with software vendors for an agile software development and DevOps approach to the new system in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
The basic requirement and the challenge at the same time was that the new system had to interact with the existing complex system landscape and that the main parts of it would be developed in a waterfall-like process. In addition, the documentation of the processes of the existing system was only very technically available.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, our Camunda partner WDW, members of Vodafone project partner Liongate, and Vodafone employees will demonstrate how they have successfully replaced their previous middleware with a new Camunda engine solution. A key success factor was the implementation of stakeholder perspective processes, which not only enabled the monitoring and validation of business processes in the existing system landscape, but also supported agile step-by-step migration.
