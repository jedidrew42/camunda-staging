Automation can take on many forms but when you combine the power of automation with machine learning capabilities, process practices quickly become transformative. In this session we show our Cognitive Request Router, how it can simplify work queues by enabling work allocation to many different systems and learning as it goes. Allowing humans to spend less time on repetitive work and more time on work that matters. We will finish with how you can layer machine learning into your Camunda instance and the power of data to measure the impact.
