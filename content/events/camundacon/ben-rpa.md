Robotic Process Automation (also known as RPA) is a much-hyped technology, and the underlying value proposition is indeed compelling. The ability to automate tedious, manual tasks such as data entry that must be completed using legacy software systems with no API can (at least in the short-term) provide enterprises with measurable benefits.

RPA products play an important role in processes but serve as a building block. Using RPA products in isolation carries the risk of not having control of the process as a whole.
Camunda BPM can work side-by-side with your RPA tool to ensure that you benefit from RPA in process execution without losing sight of the overall process.

In this tutorial, we will see a live demo of Camunda BPM playing together with one or more RPA products in order to orchestrate a business process end-to-end, and discuss the respective technical architecture.
