<p>
Do you know Camunda batch and have you ever tried to create your own custom batch with Camunda BPM? Well, we did and it was very time consuming and quite complex. There isn’t really a public API for such things. You have to work at the lowest (entity) level and take e.g. care that batch configuration is saved to the database table.
</p>
<p>
That’s why we created the Camunda BPM Custom Batch Extension (https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-custom-batch). 
</p>
<p>
The goal of the extension is to provide a simple way of using the Camunda Batch functionality for your own purposes. In this talk we’ll also show you some examples how we use the extension at Kuehne + Nagel for offloading huge workloads.
