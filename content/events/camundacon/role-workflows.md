{{<camundacon-talk title="The Role of Workflows in Microservices" date="Friday, September 21, 9:00 am" speakers="Bernd RÃ¼cker" headshot="berndruecker.jpg" about="I am co-founder of Camunda. But foremost I am software developer and consultant. I am doing BPM for more than 10 years now and committed in various Open Source Workflow Engines over time. By coaching countless projects I got totally passionate about the whole 'developer friendly BPM' story. When I have some spare time I give talks at conferences or write articles and books (e.g. our Real-Life BPMN book)." >}}
<p>
With microservices (or serverless functions) whole architectures are cut into smaller pieces that are ideally loosely coupled. In this talk I will discuss what this means for business processes that typically span more than one microservice. I will tackle questions like: How can we ensure visibility of cross-microservice flows and provide status and error monitoring? How do we guarantee that overall flows always complete, even if single services fail? How can do this without introducing tight coupling or harming service autonomy? What does this mean for your architecture and the role of workflow automation technology within it?
