description="Kaft was established in 2012. We started as a software-house focused mainly on development of custom solutions built on Java/Spring and frontend built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript frameworks. Later on we started delivering solutions with Angular, React, VueJS. As we were progressing, we also included in our offer, some 3rd party products like Camunda BPM and Elastic, Pentaho. Till now, we have successfully delivered projects for major customers in industries like: Telecom, Insurance and Medical. Thanks to our strong Java skills we quickly adopted CamundaBPM and we have done projects for Telecom and Medical customers, where Camunda was used as the main element of the overall solution. Our team is ready to help you with any Camunda related challenges."
