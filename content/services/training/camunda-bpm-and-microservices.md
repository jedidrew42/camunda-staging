targetgroup="Software developers, IT-Architects who want to understand the technical details."
courseoverview="<p>Having a bunch of nicely decoupled (micro-)services raises questions: How do the services communicate - synchronous, asynchronous or event-driven?</p><p> How can you implement complex end-to-end use cases?  How can you tackle the challenges around distributed systems?</p><p> How can you get transparency across multiple microservices? </p><p>In this three-day training course we show you how the open source platform Camunda BPM can help you to address these questions, how you orchestrate microservices and how you automate processes with Camunda without coding java classes but coding in polyglot programming languages like JavaScript, Python, C#, PHP, etc.</p>"
