courseoverview="<p>This 1-day inhouse workshop is aimed specifically at Activiti users considering a migration to Camunda BPM. Together with a project-experienced Activiti consultant you will discuss the similarities and differences between Aciviti and Camunda BPM and decide whether a migration would be beneficial to you.</p><p>You will also have the opportunity, if necessary, to examine your own BPM architecture or individual applications and look at their potential flaws. The specific steps of a migration will be described in detail so that you can estimate how much work the actual migration will be and what needs to be considered in your case.</p><p>At the end of the seminar, you can make a profound decision on the use of the two open source projects.</p>"
