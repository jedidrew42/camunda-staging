<i>Camunda supported us greatly, starting with the analysis of our specific requirements all the way to the implementation of our first project.</i> Examples for the different requests were delivered in the form of patterns, which could be implemented according to our requirements. The support convinced through its very fast response times and good solutions.{{</quote>}}

If we did encounter a problem, <i>no matter if of technical or contractual nature, it was solved fast and customer-oriented by Camunda.</i> The development of the necessary knowledge was also very competently supported. Especially our experience in how Camunda met our individual needs and wishes, was very positive (consulting, finding appointments for bug fixing, or contract terms). Thus we were able to concentrate on the aspects of introducing BPMN processes and changing the development process instead of investing unnecessary energy in coordination and technology with a new service provider.{{</quote>}}

We have never once questioned our decision to adopt Camunda BPM as a platform and make Camunda our BPM partner. Our developers could implement all necessary specifications very quickly. Our transition to the BPM world was successful and without any problems. <i>And this is due to the excellent project support provided by Camunda from 10000 km away and across 6 time zones.</i>

We evaluated a lot of BPM Products including Camunda before making a final decision. We reviewed every product from many angles such as: pricing model, maturity, documentation, supportability, flexibility, etc. and Camunda definitely won this completion. Their personal responsiveness, openness and interest played a significant role, too. Then I had some very good talks with references they provided. And finally the personal touch assured us that we are making the right decision â€“ <i>I mean the proof of concept-workshop we got in June. It left us impressed by their knowledge and professionalism.</i>
