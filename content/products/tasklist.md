End users use Camunda Tasklist to organize and work on BPMN user tasks they are supposed to complete.

During process execution, the Camunda Engine will create tasks based on the predefined BPMN model. The engine assigns those tasks to end users as defined in the model. When end users click on a task in Camunda Tasklist, they will see a task form that displays information and asks them to enter data. Once they have finished working on the task form, they complete it by clicking on a button prompting the Camunda Engine to continue the model execution.
