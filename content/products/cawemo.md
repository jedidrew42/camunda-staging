{{%list-item title="Integrated with the Camunda Stack" img="/img/products/cawemo/cawemo-project-view.png" img_shadow="true" img_width="100%" %}}
Bring visibility into your workflow automation project by integrating Cawemo with the Camunda Stack.

Via plugins for the Camunda Engine or the Camunda Modeler you can:

<ul>
  <li>sync all deployed processes of your Camunda engines with Cawemo</li>
  <li>sync latest development state through the Camunda Modeler</li>
  <li>branch off the latest production version for drafting the next iteration</li>
  <li>connect all synced diagrams of the same process to see its evolution</li>
</ul>

{{%list-item title="Keep Track of Changes" img="/img/products/cawemo/cawemo-milestone-history.png" img_shadow="true" img_width="100%" %}}
With the diagram history, you can easily compare older iterations of a workflow with your current one. By creating a milestone manually or whenever a new deployed process is synced, a new version is added to the history. The automatic diff highlights the parts of the process that were changed.
