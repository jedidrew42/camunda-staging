Struggling to bring clear end-to-end visibility to your event-driven microservices architecture? Us too! So we’ve built the first beta version of our Process Monitoring solution.<br><br>
It will enable you to leverage powerful visual reporting capabilities including dashboards, alerts and our famous heat map, even if you’re not using a Camunda Workflow Engine in each microservice or as an orchestrator.<br><br>
In this screencast, learn how Process Monitoring can bring visibility to your application when using an event-driven microservices architecture and sign up to our Beta Program.<br><br>
Work with our product team and shape this solution at an early stage. We’re also happy to promote your project on our channels.<br><br>
