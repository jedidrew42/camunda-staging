          <h3>Preamble</h3>
            <p>
                The following conditions come into effect automatically as soon as a company (hereinafter 'partner') has sent an application to participate 
                in the Camunda partner program for system integrators and Camunda has confirmed the participation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Camunda can unilaterally adjust the following conditions. In this case, the partner will be notified by Camunda in writing (by email)
                 no later than 8 weeks prior to the adaptations coming into effect.
            </p>
            <h3>1 Presentation as a Camunda partner</h3>
            <p>
                Camunda will list the partner and logo on the camunda.com website as an official partner. Form and content of the presentation are at the 
                discretion of Camunda.
            </p>
            <h3>2 Participation in public training</h3>
            <p>
                Camunda offers public training about BPM-related topcis. Permanent employees of the partner are allowed to participate in such seminars at a discount
                 of 30%. Registrations of appropriate staff will only be accepted via the respective online form on Camunda.com.
            </p>
            <h3>3 Referral Fees</h3>
            <p>
                3.1 The partner can refer potential customers ("leads") for the Camunda BPM Enterprise Edition to Camunda by filling in the appropriate online form.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.2 The partner ensures that the contact person specified in the referral form may be contacted by Camunda for sales purposes. Camunda 
                will evaluate and if appropriate confirm the referral in a timely manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.3 Commission is set at 10% of the annual fee for the first contract year of a Camunda BPM Enterprise subscription. This can only be claimed if
                <ul>
                    <li>Camunda has confirmed the reported lead in writing (via email). Camunda can grant or deny this confirmation at its discretion. 
                        Camunda will deny to confirm, if the lead is already a Camunda customer or sales communication between Camunda or a Camunda partner 
                        and the lead in regards to Camunda BPM does already exist at the time of notification.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Camunda wins the lead within 12 months after notification as a new customer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The new customer has actually paid the fee for the first year of the contract and Camunda has received the payment. 
                        In this case Camunda will pay out the appropriate commission within 30 days to the partner.
                    </li>
