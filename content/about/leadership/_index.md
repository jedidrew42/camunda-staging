                <p>
                    Camunda has been focusing on business process automation since we started the company in 2008. We
                     participated in defining the BPMN 2.0 and DMN 1.1 standards, and our book "Real-Life BPMN" has become
                     one of the most successful publications about BPMN, available in English, Spanish and German.

                <h2 class="light lead">Why "Camunda"</h2>
                <p>
                 Camunda comes from the latin verbs "capere" ("to comprehend") and "munda" ("clean"). It means that we want to deeply understand the world around us and based on that understanding we want to act in a way that is both effective and ethically correct - to make the world a better place, for all of us.
