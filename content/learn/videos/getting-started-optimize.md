Camunda Optimize supports continuous process and decision table improvement by providing transparency into your automated workflows and decisions. Business-friendly reports and dashboards as well as alerts help you to identify process bottlenecks and improve your overall process.

Watch Felix Müller give a demo of going from Optimize download, installation to creating first reports in less than 5 Minutes.

Highlights include:

- Retrieving a [trial license](/download/enterprise/)
- Downloading Optimize from [camunda.com](https://docs.camunda.org/enterprise/download/#camunda-optimize)
- [Configuring](https://docs.camunda.org/optimize/technical-guide/setup/configuration/#connection-to-camunda-bpm-platform) the connection to Camunda BPM Rest API
- [Running Optimize](https://docs.camunda.org/optimize/technical-guide/setup/installation/#demo-distribution-with-elasticsearch) locally
- Creating first [reports](/products/optimize/reports/)

If you are new to Camunda, you might want to [set up Camunda BPM](/learn/tutorials/) before watching the video.
