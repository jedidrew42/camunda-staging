title="Building Scalable Business Automation with Microservices"
teaser="<p>Organizations looking to modernize are often hampered by legacy infrastructure, monolithic application design, proprietary platforms and “untouchable” code. This legacy technical debt is swinging the pendulum from “buy” to “build” for the automation of core business operations using internal, distributed teams rather than starting with a monolithic, proprietary product.</p><p>In this whitepaper, Sandy Kemsley, noted expert in business process management and the social enterprise, compares monolithic and microservices-based business process automation platforms, with use cases for each platform model, plus best practices for migrating from a monolithic architecture to a best-of-breed microservices business automation platform.</p>__Key topics covered:__<ul>  <li>1. The fundamental capabilities Businesses require from their IT platforms</li>  <li>2. The current state of Monolithic and Microservices-based platforms</li>  <li>3. Monolithic vs Microservices architectures</li>  <li>4. Migrating your monolith to microservices</li><ul>"
