title="Case Management and CMMN for Developers"
teaser="<p>Adding flexibility to BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) processes is sometimes difficult. Therefore, the Object Management Group has created its own standard CMMN 1.0 (Case Management Model and Notation), which – just like BPMN – is executable in workflow engines.</p><p>This article introduces CMMN and shows its implementation using the Camunda open source BPM system as an example. Acceptance (or rejection) of private health insurance shall serve as a specific example.</p><p>The complete source code, including the associated BPMN and CMMN models is available on GitHub and can be executed or tried directly in Camunda‘s open source BPM platform.</p>"
