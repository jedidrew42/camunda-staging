title="3 Common Pitfalls in Microservice Integration - And How to Avoid Them "
teaser="<p>In this whitepaper, we highlight three common pitfalls organizations fall into when integrating microservices: underestimating the complexity of remote communication, ignoring the challenges of asynchronicity and forgetting about business transactions.</p><p>We will explain</p><ul>  <li>How introducing capabilities to handle these situations with stateful patterns around retries, timeouts and compensation activities can reduce the overall complexity of your microservices infrastructure and increase its resilience.</li><li>How a lightweight workflow engine such as Camunda allows you to handle these stateful patterns without investing a lot of effort or risking accidental complexity by applying homegrown solutions.</li>  </ul>"
