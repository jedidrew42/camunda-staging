teaser="<h3>Replacement of a Cobol mainframe system</h3><p>This case study describes the implementation of a core process at a leading German insurance company.</p><p>The goal was to optimize the processes as part of a change in motor insurers as well as lifting the burden on the administrators responsible.</p><p>The existing Cobol mainframe system was replaced by a new Java based and relational database based solution.</p><p>The project is the first project within this particular insurance that has managed to implement complex BPMN processes in close collaboration with the business departments. As a result, greater process transparency and standardization was achieved, which resulted in a doubling of the previous automation rate.</p>"
