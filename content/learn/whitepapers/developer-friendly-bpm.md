teaser="<h3>Look beyond the Zero-Code BPM Myth with Sandy Kemsley</h3><p>This paper explores the myth of zero-code BPM in complex projects, and how proprietary design and development tools can hinder - rather than help - skilled enterprise developers. It considers how using standard development tools and coding languages in conjunction with a BPMS can provide a bridge between business and IT without forcing either to use tools that are inappropriate for their needs: business-led functional design paired with efficient development in corporate-standard application development environments.</p><p>Key Topics covered:</p><ul><li>Limitations of Zero-Code, Model-Driven BPM</li><li>Drivers For Developer-Friendly BPM</li><li>Making Developer-Friendly BPM Work For Everyone</li><li>Business-Friendly yet executable Process Models</li></ul>"
