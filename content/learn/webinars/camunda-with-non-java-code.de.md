description="Good news for Camunda users who don't like Java: you can now orchestrate external services in a scalable, distributed pattern with JavaScript using Camunda's external task clients.<br><br>In this webinar, we'll demo the external task clients--newly available in Camunda 7.9.0--by building some processes, writing some code, and seeing everyone play nice together. <br><br>The webinar will be based on an updated Camunda Quickstart guide, so you'll have everything you need to try it out yourself after our demo.<br><br>We'll focus on the JavaScript task client, but don't worry--the Java client will make an appearance, too.<br><br>This webinar will be conducted by our Product Marketer Mike and Consultant Niall."
