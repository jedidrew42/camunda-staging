description="Camunda Optimize 2.4 was released on 29 March 2019.<br><br>In this webinar we will present a number of new, exciting features of Optimize 2.4 including:<br><br>•	DMN Reports which allow users to quickly identify unused or heavily used rules so that they can subsequently improve their decision tables<br>•	User Task Reports which allow process owners to track how much time is spend working on tasks and how much time is being used until the first assignment<br>•	Reports & Dashboards in Collections which make it easier to find the report or dashboard you are looking for<br>•	Clustering which allows you to run multiple Optimize instances in parallel so that you can scale horizontally (e.g. for failover scenarios)<br>•	Support for Elasticsearch 6.2.0+, 6.3.1+, 6.4.0+, 6.5.0+ to give more flexibility when it comes to choosing an Elasticsearch version<br>"
