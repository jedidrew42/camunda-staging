description="In April 2019, we announced the first-ever preview release of Camunda Operate, a tool that is purpose-built for monitoring and managing workflow instances that are running in Zeebe (https://zeebe.io). The Operate preview is available for unrestricted non-production use. <br><br>Join us for this webinar to learn more about:<br>• The problem that Operate solves, for whom, and why we think it's important<br>• How to use Operate to get visibility into and control over cross-microservice workflows<br>• How to get started with Zeebe and Operate (hint: https://docs.zeebe.io/getting-started/README.html)<br><br>We'd love to hear your questions and feedback. <br><br>We'll be sending out a recording of the webinar to all registrants, so feel free to sign up even if you won't be able to attend live.
