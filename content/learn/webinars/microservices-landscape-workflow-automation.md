description="A company’s core business processes nearly always span more than one microservice. In an e-commerce company, for example, a “customer order” might involve different services for payments, inventory, shipping and more. But how do these services play together to fulfill the customer’s desire? <br><br>Implementing long-running, asynchronous, and complex collaborations between distributed microservices is challenging. How can we ensure visibility of cross-microservice flows and provide status and error monitoring? How do we guarantee that overall flows always complete, even if single services fail? Or how do we recognize stuck flows so that we can fix them?<br><br>In this webinar, Bernd will explain how workflow automation supports the orchestration of microservices, to make sure business processes are always carried out - even in case of failure -<br>providing monitoring and visibility into the overall progress and status. <br><br>He will reveal how to do all of this without introducing monolithic workflows that clash with microservices principles. You will also learn how to balance orchestration (using a workflow engine) with choreography (using events). Still believe that choreography is more loosely coupled and thus the modern way to go? You definitely need to listen in...<br><br><br>__Webinar Date: Wednesday, Mar 11, 2020, 8am PT/ 11am ET / 4pm CET<br><br>Speaker:__<br><br><img src='https://images.ctfassets.net/vpidbgnakfvf/65ZZSpbquIwOcwvFR5u1BZ/1c436dbd3ab84b888efcfe9700a03954/BerndRuecker-Webinar-150px.png' style='float:left;padding: 0px 10px 70px 0px;'> __Bernd Ruecker, Chief Technologist and Co-founder__<br>Tech evangelist, public speaker, co-founder and chief technologist of Camunda – Bernd’s name is legend among developers.
