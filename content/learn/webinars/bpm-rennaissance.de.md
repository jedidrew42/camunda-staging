description="A decade ago, business process management (BPM) focused on modeling and perhaps automating stable, repeatable back-office processes. Even with the bar set this low, many of the BPM tools on the market struggled to meet the needs of the business.<br><br>Today, business processes are more dynamic. Enterprises are more likely to focus on customer-facing, front-office processes. Low-code tools improve collaboration, increase quality, and lower technical debt. And we have yet to maximize the full power of the cloud. Welcome to the BPM renaissance.<br><br>On this live webinar, listen to Jason Bloomberg, president of analyst firm Intellyx, and Daniel Myer, CTO Camunda, as they discuss how today’s BPM addresses business problems the way first-generation BPM never could. They will cover the five core value propositions of next-generation BPM and explain how low-code technologies and cloud-native computing change the BPM game, allowing you to not just survive, but also thrive through these transformative times.<br><br>__Webinar Date: Wednesday, Feb 12, 2020, 8am PT/ 11am ET / 5pm CET__<br><br>__Speakers:__<br><br><img src='https://images.ctfassets.net/vpidbgnakfvf/2Wi8UQ3u04wZnA5pAek2s6/accb4f0cfde127d1b74c235687291c94/DanielMyer-Webinar-150px.png' style='float:left;padding: 0px 10px 60px 0px;'>__Daniel Meyer, Camunda CTO__<br><br>The mastermind behind some of Camunda’s biggest technological developments, Chief Technology Officer Daniel joined us in 2010, serving first as a developer and consultant – coaching companies in BPM technology.
