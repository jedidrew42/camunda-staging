description="We invite you to join us for the Camunda Optimize 2.7 release webinar on Tuesday, January 7, 2020 at 5:00pm Central European Time / 11:00am Eastern Standard Time. <br><br>Optimize provides business activity monitoring for workflows, supporting continuous process improvement by providing transparency into your automated workflows and decisions. Optimize’s business-friendly reports, dashboards, and alerts make it possible to identify process bottlenecks and improve end-to-end processes.<br><br>Here are some of the highlights from the 2.7 release that we'll cover in the webinar: <br><br>• __Faster insights into the live state of your business:__ Optimize isn’t just about after-the-fact analysis; monitoring live instances in near real time is also a key use capability. New filtering features enable users to more quickly get insights into running processes–all the way down to a specific step in a process. <br><br>• __More secure cross-team collaboration with fine-grained control over sensitive data:__ Last quarter’s Optimize 2.6 introduced a new and robust user permissions system, making it possible to give a wide range of stakeholders access to Optimize while limiting who’s able to see what. 2.7 streamlines common user management tasks so you can get the right users access to the right data as quickly as possible. <br><br>All registrants will receive an email with a link to the webinar recording, so please feel free to sign up even if you're not sure you can attend the live event.<br>"
