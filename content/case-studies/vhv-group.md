companydescription="<p>VHV Group operates through its brands and companies in insurance, pensions and asset management. It is number 1 in the construction business, number 2 in life insurance direct business, number 4 in the deposit business and number 5 in the automotive business.</p>"
customerquote="<p><q>To automate its business processes, VHV is increasingly using process models based on BPMN 2.0 standards. In future, this development ought to be accompanied by an increased integration of such models into the technical implementation. Camunda BPM represents an interesting expansion to our own process platform. The possibility to run BPMN 2.0 models directly, the BPM roundtrip between specialist departments and IT and also the product’s attractive licensing model, have prompted us to use Camunda BPM in our company. Last but not least the competent care provided by Camunda’s employees as part of a recent workshop could also convince us of a collaboration.</q></p>-Dr. Adam Melski, Head of Strategic Development"
