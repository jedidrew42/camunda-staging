customerquote="<p><q>Camunda and especially Camunda BPM as a BPM platform was the ideal solution for us, because the necessary software knowledge already existed within the company and did not have to be established anew. Furthermore, the whole package was very attractive as Camunda provides BPMN knowledge as well as the needed software. This made an optimal start with BPMN 2.0 and process automation possible.</q></p>-Christian Lorenz, Team Leader Central Product System"
