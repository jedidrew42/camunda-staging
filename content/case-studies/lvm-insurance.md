The possibility to use this powerful open source project backed up with professional support, an attractive licensing model and highly competent consulting, finally convinced us. We are currently implementing our first project that kicked off with a BPMN 2.0 in-house training by Camunda. It took only a few days to highly inspire the whole project team (consisting of people from both IT and business departments) for process mapping with BPMN 2.0, which means that the first improved processes are already emerging.</q></p>-Thorsten Schramm, Team Lead IT infrastructure"
