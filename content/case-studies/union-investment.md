They combined the decades of experience of the private banks in the fund business with the general structure and the values of the cooperative banks. More than four million customers show that this has been successfully achieved.

customerquote="<p><q>We are using Camunda BPM in very business-critical processes. The open source solution is the systematic way for us to document business processes by modeling them in BPMN 2.0 as well automating them. For the design and specification of new functions and processes, BPMN 2.0 provides an important basis, thereby making a common understanding of processes between IT and the customer possible. Due to our positive experiences with Camunda BPM, the platform is now being used at various places within the investment process of the company and is becoming increasingly popular.</q></p>-AndrÃ© Herchenhan, FBB Investment - Processing"
