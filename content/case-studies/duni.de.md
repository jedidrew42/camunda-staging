customerquote="<p><q>In a changing environment, being able to develop transparent processes and reliable information flows fast is key to success.  Yet many solutions available take long time to develop, offer only limited flexibility and are either hard to use or hard to adapt. Camunda BPM enables us to do drive those changes in a structured and transparent way. We are looking forward to getting advantages with process orchestration throughout many systems – we hope that this will allow us to grab synergies which so far have been difficult to achieve due to diversified system environment.</q></p>-Fritz Ulrich, Process Development Specialist"
