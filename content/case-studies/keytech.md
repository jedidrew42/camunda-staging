customerquote="<p><q>Optimal support for business processes has always played an important role in our PLM and DMS solutions. In order to offer our customers a noticeable added value in this area beyond our own workflow engine, we have decided to integrate a BPMN engine into keytech. Seamless integration into our own software was therefore an important criterion. With Camunda, this project can be implemented excellently. Furthermore, we were convinced that with CMMN and DMN case and decision management will be supported. In the past, Camunda has proven in many projects that it can cope well with complex processes. </q></p>-Dr. rer. nat Alfred Heimsoth, Product Manager"
