customerquote="<p><q>In order for Swisscom to remain competitive it always – amongst other measures – migrates its network technologies according to the cutting edge of technology. Swisscom customers expect high quality service, if possible without interruption times. The Camunda BPMN 2.0 engine allows us to flexibly and transparently meet these high demands. By visualizing the overall process, it is possible to transparently map migrations and see the impact on individual customers at any time. In 2014 thousands of migrations were successfully and automatically processed and these have thus contributed significantly to customer satisfaction. Camunda has not only helped us in the creation of automated services but also assisted with demanding support cases at any time.</q></p>-Alex Obrist, Head of Network Provisioning & Inventory"
