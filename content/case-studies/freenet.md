companydescription="<p>freenet Group is the biggest network-independent telecommunications provider in Germany. The Group is in the process of establishing itself in the Digital Lifestyle sector as a provider of household / at-home solutions for customers that are not directly related to telecommunications.</p>"
customerquote="<p><q>Two things are important to us for the automation of our core processes: high availability in a high-load scenario and the integration into our existing Java EE6 programming model. Both are given with Camunda BPM. In productive operation the following load can currently be easily handled:</p><ul><li>up to 700,000 process instances per month</li><li>up to 25,000 process instances per day</li><li>up to 1600 process instances per hour</li></ul><p>We are using 3 JBoss nodes, each of them on a server with 2 cores for one JBoss instance. Thanks to the embedded Camunda process engine the pass-through time of each process instances is really quick, the overhead for service calls is insignificant. Additionally we can use our existing Java knowledge combined with Camunda BPM to quickly and easily build lightweight process solutions. Surely there are more to follow. Besides the technology, the professional support provided by Camunda comes also highly recommended.</p>-Mahmut Izci, Head of IT"
