companydescription="<p>BOCOM BBM originated in a joint venture between one of China’s oldest and largest banks and Brazil’s oldest private financial group. It is the result of an association between two banks that are recognized for their tradition and excellence. With agility and transparency, we offer the best solutions and financial services in the corporate and wealth management segments.</p>"
customerquote="<p>'We were looking for alternatives to build complex services from our API’s, but were frustrated about low-code composition frameworks, especially for their inability to play well with our DevOps environment. Camunda, on the other hand, fit the bill perfectly: its low footprint java engine, Spring Boot integration, and fully exposed REST API’s allowed it to blend seamlessly into our pipeline.'</p> <p>-Carlos Jourdan, I.T. General Manager</p>"
