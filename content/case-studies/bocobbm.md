customerquote="<p>'We were looking for alternatives to build complex services from our API’s, but were frustrated about low-code composition frameworks, especially for their inability to play well with our DevOps environment. Camunda, on the other hand, fit the bill perfectly: its low footprint java engine, Spring Boot integration, and fully exposed REST API’s allowed it to blend seamlessly into our pipeline.'</p> <p>-Carlos Jourdan, I.T. General Manager</p>"
