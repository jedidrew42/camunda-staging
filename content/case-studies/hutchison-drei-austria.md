By adhering to the network migration schedule, the network was rebuilt in time for the important connect test, which we won this year for the third time. During the project, the organization enjoyed the process-oriented work and the Camunda process engine. After the project was completed, we therefore immediately started incorporating all our critical technical processes into the Camunda engine.
