companydescription="<p>Zalando is Europe's largest online platform for fashion. The extensive range for men, women and children as well as accessories and sporting goods ranges from global brands, local and fast-fashion brands to self-designed private labels - altogether Zalando works with more than 1,500 brand-name manufacturers. The Berlin-based company was founded in 2008 by Robert Gentz and David Schneider and now supplies a total of 15 European markets.</p>"
customerquote="<p><q>To further automate our business processes, we are using Camunda BPM: The open platform permits the implementation of our individual needs in a way that closed BPM suites just cannot achieve. Our BPMN 2.0 process models are executed directly, which improved communication between business departments and development and shortens development cycles. Thanks to Camunda’s additional advice we were able to instantly involve all stakeholders into the process design and were also able to swiftly start the technical implementation.</q></p>-Marko Lehn, Teamlead Software Engineering"
