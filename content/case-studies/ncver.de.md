It is a professional and independent body responsible for collecting, managing, analyzing, evaluating and communicating research and statistics about vocational education and training (VET) nationally.</p>"
customerquote="<p><q>NCVER chose Camunda BPM over other products due to its simple and seamless integration with our existing product set. Getting it up and running really is as easy as they say it is and we had a working demo in less than an hour. Camunda’s support staff are friendly and helpful and although we have had no problems with the product so far they have proved very useful in getting us up and running quickly and efficiently.</q></p>-Phil Crick, Team Lead Technical Architecture"
