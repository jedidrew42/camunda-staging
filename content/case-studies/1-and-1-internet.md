customerquote="<p><q>We have been using BPM to model, implement, and run our business processes for several years now. After a great experience with jBPM 3, we had to search for a modern process engine that would allow us to offer the best service quality to our customers, e.g. when they order our products. Reliable process execution and high throughput are very important requirements. Additionally, our process engines have to integrate seamlessly with our Java EE infrastructure based on JBoss AS. Finally, we prefer open-source solutions which give us full control over the technology and allow for the development of specific adaptations if needed. Camunda BPM turned out to be an ideal solution for us. We also see an excellent opportunity to share our process knowledge with others and to benefit from an active community behind Camunda BPM.</q></p>"
