companydescription="<p>The Deutsche Bahn (German Rail) is one of the largest transport and logistics companies in the world. Its most important partner for ICT solutions is DB Systel. DB Systel employs 3,400 people who plan, develop and operate approximately 600 productive IT applications throughout the entire Deutsche Bahn group.</p>"
customerquote="<p><q>In Camunda we found a BPM engine that grows flexibly and can be easily customized by Java developers. The step towards executable process models was particularly easy with Camunda BPM because more than any other Business Process Management System Camunda BPM consistently works with BPMN 2.0.</p><p>Decisive for contracting Camunda was also the licensing model. Especially for small and medium-sized projects DB Systel is increasingly using Open Source. Not to be dependent on a single vendor thanks to open-source software was rated as an additional advantage.</q></p>-Henry HÃ¼bler, project manager DB Systel and Ingo Rau, CEO econauten"
