companydescription="<p>With more than 4.8 million policyholders and pensioners at home and abroad, the Pensionsversicherungsanstalt (PVA) is one of the largest social security institutions in Austria. As part of the health system it performs its services not only in the main office in Vienna and the nine provincial offices but also operates 15 specialist hospitals.</p>"
customerquote="<p><q>Rising IT requirements on the one hand and the economic necessities on the other hand required the implementation of a future-oriented, unified, process-optimized and intermodal IT support in the field of pension insurance (ZEPTA). In order to automate all business processes the Pensionsversicherungsanstalt relies on Camunda BPM. This open platform allows tailor-made illustration and control of processes in the core business. The use of Java offers a quixck start for classical software developers and established test methods for process development such as unit and integration tests can be used. The insight into Camunda's source code and the available documentation allow a deep insight into the underlying mechanisms that closed BPM suites cannot offer. The direct execution of processes modelled in BPMN 2.0 facilitates the coordination of business department and development and shortens the response time to incidents.</q></p>"
