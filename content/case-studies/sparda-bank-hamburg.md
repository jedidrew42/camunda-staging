companydescription="<p>With a balance sheet total of 3.1 billion EUR, 250,000 members and 318,000 customers, Sparda Bank Hamburg is the biggest cooperative bank in Northern Germany.</p>"
customerquote="<p><q>Since 2005 we have been creating applications that support business processes using BPM tools. For current developments, we were now looking for a process engine based on BPMN 2.0 and one that would be easily integrated into our existing Java infrastructure. In Camunda BPM we found a lightweight solution that can also easily be integrated into Java EE applications using existing Java expertise. It is also important to us that Camunda BPM is a vital open source project and at the same time stable enough for productive use. The possibility of a commercial support, as well as the previously positive experiences with training and support provided by Camunda were also crucial in the decision making process.</q></p>-André Rühmkorf, Team Lead Application Development"
