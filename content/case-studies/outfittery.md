companydescription="OUTFITTERY is Europe's largest personal shopping service for men. At www.outfittery.de, customers first answer a few questions about clothing style, sizes and price preferences. A personal stylist then puts together a selection of clothes that the customer can send home to try on. To select the ideal wardrobe, the stylists are supported by algorithms. What the customer likes, he keeps, the rest he sends back free of charge. OUTFITTERY's aim is to make shopping for men as relaxed as possible and to make it as easy as possible through a combination of personal service and intelligent technology to provide the perfect choice for everyone. The Berlin-based company was founded in 2012 by Julia BÃ¶sch and Anna Alex. Since then, more than 600,000 men have used the service throughout Europe. The range includes around 100 high-quality fashion brands. The young company is active in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden and Denmark."
