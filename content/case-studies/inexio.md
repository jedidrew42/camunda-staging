customerquote="<p><q>To be competitive as a fast-growing company, inexio has always relied on process automation. For reasons of scalability a change of our process engine made sense and the search for a BPMN 2.0 platform quickly led us to Camunda. The offered enterprise support is necessary for us to use for the control of mission-critical processes. The decisive factor was the ability to integrate the process engine into our non-Java application landscape. During the migration, Camunda Consulting skilfully supported and advised us. The availability of the software as open source is a welcome bonus.</q></p><p>-Jonas Langhabel, Software Developer</p>"
