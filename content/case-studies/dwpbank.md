companydescription="<p>Deutsche WertpapierService Bank AG (dwpbank) is the leading securities settlement service provider for Germany’s financial market. With 1,500 member banks in total, more than 75% of all German banks use dwpbank’s securities settlement processes and systems.</p>"
customerquote="<p><q>In the context of renewing our core system we have decided to enable new potential by introducing a BPM platform. The decision to take Camunda BPM has proven to be the right one regarding our special aims. The engine was integrated into our system with little effort and since then runs unobtrusively and without any problems. If we did encounter a problem, no matter if of technical or contractual nature, it was solved fast and customer-oriented by Camunda. The development of the necessary knowledge was also very competently supported. Especially our experience in how Camunda met our individual needs and wishes, was very positive (consulting, finding appointments for bug fixing, or contract terms). Thus we were able to concentrate on the aspects of introducing BPMN processes and changing the development process instead of investing unnecessary energy in coordination and technology with a new service provider.</q></p>-Dirk Schaube, Applications"
