customerquote="<p><q>By introducing a BPM platform into our core system we were able to generate a new way of thinking and perception of many business processes in our banks.</p> <p>The decision to take Camunda BPM was clear from the beginning: The light-weighted engine from Camunda has been integrated into our system with little effort and since then runs without any problems. Both in the trainings with Camunda and in consulting and support we got to know Camunda as a young and dynamic team that answered our questions and solved all our problems very fast and also very competently. Furthermore, Camunda has an excellent own modeler that allows us to model our business processes fast and easily. </q></p>-Dr. Michael Lintner, Project Manager"
