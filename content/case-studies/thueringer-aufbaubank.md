companydescription="<p>The Thüringer Aufbaubank (TAB) was founded in 1992 as an institution under public law (Thüringer Aufbaubankgesetz). Since then, the bank has taken on numerous tasks in economic, agricultural and housing promotion for the Free State of Thuringia. The TAB also supports the municipalities of Thuringia in areas of financing. With nearly 400 employees, it is involved in further developing business in the region of Thuringia."
customerquote="<p><q>The ability to comfortably monitor and migrate running process instances have led us to replace the former Model Execution Engine and rely on Camunda. The implementation of the standards CMNN and DMN was equally convincing. With the use of Camunda, we expect more flexibility in mapping new processes, easier adjustments to ongoing processes, and future-proofing of the product through further development in a large and active community.</q></p><p>-Jürgen Krug, Head of Technology and Development</p>"
