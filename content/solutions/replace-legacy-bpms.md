To implement workflow automation, many organizations have purchased BPMS (also known as “BPM Suites”), usually provided by larger vendors. In many cases, these products could not deliver on their promises, and worse, they imposed one or more of the following problems on their users:

* Heavyweight system that is hard to install and to maintain.
* Closed architecture, hard to integrate with your technology stack.
* Required their proprietary approach to application development, disliked by software developers and limited in flexibility.
* Lack of support for BPMN, or missing features and tools.
* Issues with performance and scalability.
* Difficult to get qualified, affordable professional services.
* Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) too high, in part due to high maintenance fees.

As a result, many organizations decided to get rid of these legacy systems and replaced their BPMS with Camunda BPM.

Camunda was designed from the start with developers in mind:

* Camunda BPM can be used both as a standalone process engine server or embedded inside custom Java applications.
* Camunda BPM also provides a REST API so that non-Java developers can build applications that connect to a remote process engine.
* For high availability and scalability, Camunda can run on a distributed cluster while relying on one shared database.

Camunda takes care of business users, too, and Camunda BPM provides extensive tooling for non-developers:

* Camunda defines workflows using ISO-standard [BPMN 2.0](/bpmn/), providing a common language for technical and non-technical users.
* [Cawemo](/products/cawemo/) enables business users to collaborate with multiple stakeholders to create, edit and specify BPMN process diagrams for developers to deploy.
* [Camunda Modeler](/products/modeler/) allows developers to edit BPMN process diagrams and DMN decision tables, and deploy workflows to the Camunda Engines to execute them.
* [Camunda Optimize](/products/optimize/) provides live monitoring and reports for business stakeholders so that no question about a process is left unanswered.

Camunda also includes a Decision Model and Notation (DMN) Decision Engine so that business users can define and maintain executable business rules that integrate directly with the workflow engine.

And Camunda BPM is open source under the Apache 2.0 License, which means you have direct access to the source code and a minimal vendor lock-in.
