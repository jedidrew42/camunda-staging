{{%list-item title="Replace Homegrown Workflow Technology" img="/img/solutions/replace-homegrown-tech.svg" img_width="30%" link="/solutions/replace-homegrown-workflows" link_label="Learn more"%}}
Many organizations get started with workflow automation by building software from scratch--for example, hard-coding a process in Java or creating a simple state machine.

But these systems become hard to maintain, offering limited scalability and requiring developers to reinvent the wheel.

Camunda BPM offers a compelling alternative to homegrown software: it's lightweight and developer friendly, highly embeddable, and highly customizable.

Software vendors in a range of industries have recognized the value in offering their customers workflow automation in their product.

While vendors could build their own workflow engine from scratch, this is a resource-intensive effort and adds considerable overhead to a project.

Including an existing BPM platform in a product offers a compelling alternative to building one from scratch.
