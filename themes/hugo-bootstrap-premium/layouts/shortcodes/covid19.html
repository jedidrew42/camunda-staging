    <p>We know many initiatives are working hard to help society tackle the challenges created by COVID-19.</p>
    <p>We have seen many organizations pivoting fast to respond to urgent needs - either to support the overburdened health care systems directly, to help manage unexpected demand or to better organize tasks for a workforce that is suddenly working remotely.</p>
    <p>That’s where we can help you.</p>
    <p><strong>Are you an Initiative directly helping society tackle the COVID-19 pandemic?</strong></p>
    <p>We’ve put together a special package for organizations that do not have the in-house resources to scale quickly to meet the challenges posed by COVID-19:
    <ul>
    <li>We will donate our Enterprise products completely free of charge so you can scale operations as fast as possible.</li>
    <li>Our experts will help your teams hit the ground running with Camunda consulting and online training.</li>
    <li>Our experienced support teams will be on hand to help each step of the way</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
