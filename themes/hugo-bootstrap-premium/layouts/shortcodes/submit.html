		<p><strong>Why should I do this?</strong></p>
		<p>If you are using Camunda, you certainly have a story to tell: What you are using it for, which benefits you gained, which challenges you had to overcome, what you have learned on the way.</p>
		<p>Share these insights with others, and you will be rewarded: You will build your personal network, present your organization as a great place to work or do business with, and you will probably get helpful feedback and tips from other users that are facing similar challenges.</p>
		<p><strong>Who's my audience?</strong></p>
		<p>Typically, you will be speaking to software developers, software architects and IT executives of all levels.</p>
		<p><strong>How should I present?</strong></p>
		<p>In whatever way you're comfortable: Some prefer pure powerpoint presentations, others like to get hands-on and give a demo or even do some live hacking. Often, it's a mix of slides and demo. Presentations typically run for 15 to 45 minutes.</p>
